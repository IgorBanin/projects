								Hello!
								<br>
								<br>
								My name is Igor Banin and I am a graduate from the University of Washington with a bachelors in Applied Physics. 
                I am interested in computer science education, electronics, data analysis, and how technology can be used for the better good.
				 				<br>
				 				<br>
                I am currently looking for entry-level employment as a Software Engineer in New York. Previously, I have worked as a Software
                Engineer Intern at Intel IAGS for Client Platforms Enabling. There I learned many valuable skills about the development
                pipeline, engineering approach, effective debugging, and testing. During my time as an intern I worked on developing
                a testing framework for a Prototype Hardware Acceleration POC in C++. I tested and analyzed Personalizer AI models
                using WinMLRunner, profiled models in OpenVINO and aided in presenting findings of model CPU runtime data to major
                ISV partners. Additionally, I elevated the productivity of Excel workload testing by automating dynamic collection
                of CPU information and iteration count processing at runtime using PowerShell, Batch and VBA.
                <br>
				 				<br>
                During my final year at UW, as a continuation of my pursuit in how technology can be used for the better good;
                I spent 6 months working on Undergrad Physics Research developing a <a href="https://github.com/Novel-Observations-in-Mixed-Reality/Optics">VR Optics Lab</a>
                in C#, using MRTK as a part of <a href="https://github.com/Novel-Observations-in-Mixed-Reality/NOMR">NOMR(Novel Observations in Mixed Reality)</a>.
                This was an amazing opportunity to meet and work with very talented individuals, as well as tie together my interests in both Education and Programming.
                This opportunity allowed me to push my programming skills past what was regularly taught in class, and create something that could eventually be used
                to teach Physics students Optics concepts. The concept of implementing VR labs being evermore relevant due to the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result all
                learning being pushed online - VR labs were being used to bridge that lack of in person learning.
                <br>
				 				<br>
				 				Prior to that I worked as a programming and robotics instructor at STEP Computer Academy; where I
                taught classes of up to 12 students to program in Python and Basic Objective C for Arduino. I designed
                curriculums and ran projects: like how to program a camera sensor using Python on Raspberry Pi or
                designing an <a href="https://github.com/ItStepArduino/Snake">8x8 LED matrix snake game</a> controlled by an Analog Joystick. I love to build, program,
                and design: the summer of 2018 I built a <a href="https://github.com/IgorBanin/timelaser">laser drawing time display</a>, controlled through xy servo motors,
                and programmed through vector graphics. In school, I worked in a team to analyze health data API through
                GHDx to draw conclusions on <a href="https://igorbanin.shinyapps.io/final_project/">mortality rates</a>. Through partner projects, I implemented TF-IDF and PageRank algorithms
                for a search engine, a maze generator through Kruskal’s MST, as well as a maze solver using Dijkstra’s.
                At DubHacks 2017 I programmed the distribution of a link shortening service called <a href="https://devpost.com/software/linklives">Link Lives</a>, using a <a href="https://github.com/IgorBanin/dubhacks2017">reddit bot</a>
                through PRAW.

				 				More about me! I am bilingual, I can speak both English and Russian. I am a frequent gym goer, and I enjoy
                lifting. I love playing practically every sport, but I primarily play pickup basketball and
                ultimate frisbee with friends. I love to travel. I am an avid photographer and I love to experience new things, whether that be meeting
                new people, trying new food, or seeing new places. I love to hike and program. I am currently learning more about 
                <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/">back end development</a> and implementing what I'm learning 
                in one of my ongoing fullstack projects to create a blogging website. Current developments on that can be found <a href="https://github.com/IgorBanin/blogsite">here!</a>
