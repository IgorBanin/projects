								Hey!
								<br>
								<br>
								My name is Igor Banin and I am a student studying Applied Physics at the University of Washington,
                graduating in June 2020. I am interested in computer science education, electronics, data analysis,
                and how we can use technology for the better good.
				 				<br>
				 				<br>
				 				I am currently working as a programming and robotics instructor at STEP Computer Academy; where I
                teach classes of up to 12 students to program in Python and Basic Objective C for Arduino. I design
                curriculums and run projects: like how to program a camera sensor using Python on Raspberry Pi or
                designing an <a href="https://github.com/ItStepArduino/Snake">8x8 LED matrix snake game</a> controlled by an Analog Joystick. I love to build, program,
                and design: this past summer I built a <a href="https://github.com/IgorBanin/timelaser">laser drawing time display</a>, controlled through xy servo motors,
                and programmed through vector graphics. In school, I worked in a team to analyze health data API through
                GHDx to draw conclusions on <a href="https://igorbanin.shinyapps.io/final_project/">mortality rates</a>. Through partner projects, I implemented TF-IDF and PageRank
                for a search engine, a maze generator through Kruskal’s MST, as well as a maze solver using Dijkstra’s.
                At DubHacks 2017 I programmed the distribution of a link shortening service called <a href="https://devpost.com/software/linklives">Link Lives</a>, using a <a href="https://github.com/IgorBanin/dubhacks2017">reddit bot</a>
                through PRAW.
				 				<br>
				 				<br>
				 				More about me! I am bilingual, I can speak both English and Russian. I am a frequent gym goer, and I enjoy
                lifting. I love playing practically every sport, but I primarily play pickup basketball and
                ultimate frisbee with friends. I love to travel: this summer I am going to Germany, Switzerland, Amsterdam,
                London, and New York. I am an avid photographer and I love to experience new things, whether that be meeting
                new people, trying new food, or seeing new places. I love to hike and program. I am currently working on
                familiarizing myself with Python’s <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensor Flow</a> library to dive deeper into the world of
                Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
